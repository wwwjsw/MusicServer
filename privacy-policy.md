Thank you for choosing MusicServer. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application (the "App").

### 1. Information We Collect
Our App does not collect, store, or process any personal data from its users. The App is designed to function solely as a local music server and client, and all interactions occur within your local network.

### 2. How Your Information Is Used
Since we do not collect personal information, no user data is stored, shared, or processed by our servers or any third-party services. All operations are limited to the devices within your local network.

### 3. Data Security
We prioritize the security of your local data. Here’s how we ensure your data remains secure:
- The App only communicates with devices connected to your local network.
- No data is transmitted to external servers or over the internet.
- You have complete control over the content shared between the server and client applications.

### 4. Third-Party Services
Our App does not integrate or interact with third-party services or APIs. All features and functionalities are self-contained and operate within your local environment.

### 5. Your Control and Rights
Because no personal data is collected, you don’t need to manage or delete any stored information related to the App. You control the music files and content shared through the App.
